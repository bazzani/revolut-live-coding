Register instances

x It should be possible to register a backend instance, identified by an url address
x Each address should be unique, it should NOT be possible to register the same address more than once
x Load balancer should accept up to 10 addresses

Random invocation

Develop an algorithm that, when invoking the Load Balancer's get() method multiple times,
should return one backend-instance choosing between the registered ones randomly.


----

Round-Robin invocation

Develop an algorithm that, when invoking multiple times the Load Balancer on its get() method,
should return one backend-instance choosing between the registered one sequentially (round-robin).
